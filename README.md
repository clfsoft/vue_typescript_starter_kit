# vuejs_typescript_starter_kit

> A Vue.js/Typescript/Vuex/Webpack starter pack  
> I've basically tried to put together the minimum you need to get started   
> Typescript typing works throughout as far as I can tell, including within single-file VUE components  
> Webpack works great both in dev mode (dev server with auto-reload), and in build mode    

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
